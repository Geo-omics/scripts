# Run this shell script in a directory containing bin fasta files to get a
# summary tab-delimited file to import the bins as a collection in ANVIO.  It
# was originally written for VizBin collections, but will work for any group of
# Bin fastas generated from any binning program

# Make a list of contigs in each bin, and add the bin file in a column next to the contig:
for i in *.fa; do
	grep ">" "$i" | sed "s/$/	$i/" > "${i}".list;
done

# Concactenate the data into one list file:
cat ./*.list > cat.list

# remove the file extension from the bin name:
sed 's/.fa//g' cat.list > cat2.list

# Remove the ">" leftover from fasta headers:
sed 's/>//g' cat2.list > VizBin_binning_results.txt

# delete intermediate files:
rm ./*.list
