# Michigan Geomicrobiology Lab
Welcome to the GitHub Repo for some general purpose NGS, Data analysis and mining scripts used in the lab. Some scripts implement our short-read QC, assembly, binning, etc. pipeline and depend on the presence of a number of third-party software.  The rest are Bash scripts or in core [Perl](http://www.perl.org/ "Perl Home") or [Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python Home"). This means, if you have Perl or Python 3 installed, you won't need anything else to work with these scripts.<br>
Since these scripts are actively being used by the Lab, you can expect full support for any [issues](https://github.com/Geo-omics/scripts/issues "Report an issue"). Please do let us know if you find any bugs or easier/quicker/more elegant solutions.<br>
<br>
This material is based upon work supported by the **National Science Foundation** under Grant Number **EAR-1035955**.<br>

## Language and OS Dependencies
The scripts should work with variuos flavors of Linux and other unix-like environments.  Here is a list of easy to install languages that you'll need:
* Perl version 5.10 +
* Python version 3.5 +
* R version 3 +
