.. program:: omics run

========================================
run - run command inside omics container
========================================


Synopsis
========

:program:`omics run` [OPTIONS...] [``--``] COMMAND...


Description
===========

This is a wrapper around :command:`singularity run`.  It runs the given command
inside the omics container environment.  if :program:`omics run` is called from
a shell then command may need to be protected from the shell with single or
double quotes as needed.  The container will provide a clean environment, so if
environment variables are needed inside, e.g. ``SOMEVAR=foobar``, then set instead
``SINGULARITYENV_SOMEVAR=foobar``, and the variable will be set with the
``SINGULARITYENV_`` prefix stripped.

Options
=======

Any options given to this script must be separated from the COMMAND
by a double dash, otherwise the COMMAND will be interpreted as
options with unintended consequences likely.

.. option:: -i PATH, --container-image PATH

    Full path to singularity container image.  A default is provided if this
    option is missing.

.. option:: -s option, --singularity option

    Options passed on to :command:`singularity`.  For instance, to additionally mount a
    path ``/some/path``, add ``--singularity "-B /some/path"`` and the option
    ``-B /some/path`` will be appended to the call to :command:`singularity run`.  The
    empty space between the option and its parameter must be protected by
    quotes to prevent premature word splitting by the shell.  Run
    :command:`singularity run --help` to see what options are supported.

.. option:: --working-dir PATH

    Set the working directory for the command

.. option:: -h, --help

    Print help.

.. option:: --no-color

    Disable colorful terminal output

.. option:: -v, --verbosity N

    Set verbosity level or use one or multiple :option:`-v` to increase verbosity of output.


Exit Status
===========

Exits with non-zero upon encountering an error.
