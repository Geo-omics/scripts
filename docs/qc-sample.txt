.. program:: omics qc-sample

==========================================================
qc-sample - quality control for metagenomic Illumina reads
==========================================================

Synopsis
========

:program:`omics qc-sample` [OPTIONS]...


Description
===========

The :program:`omics qc-sample` script takes a pair of fastq-formatted files
(forward and reverse reads, data from a single sample) and runs them past
quality assessment (FastQC), dereplication, adapter removal (Scythe), and
quality-trimming (Sickle) steps and then prepares a FASTA-formatted interleaved
reads file that can be used as input for the IDBA assembler.  A second run of
FastQC allows a before-after comparison to see if these steps led to an
improvement in the quality of the data.


positional arguments
====================

.. option:: samples

    List of directories, one per sample that contain the sample's reads. The
    default is to take the current directory and process a single sample. The
    names of the reads files must be fwd.fastq and rev.fastq, currently this
    can not be set manually. Use the omics-qc-sample script directly to
    specify filenames, omics-qc is just a wrapper after all.


Options
=======

.. option:: -f, --fwd=FILE

    fastq-formatted file with forward reads, by default this is ``fwd.fastq``
    as saved by the :program:`prep` script

.. option:: -r, --rev=FILE

    fastq-formatted file with reverse reads, by default this is ``rev.fastq``
    as saved by the :program:`prep` script

.. option:: --clean-only

    Remove all files made by a previously run of :program:`qc` and exit.

.. option:: -a, --adapters=FILE

    Specify the adapters file used in the adpater trimming step.  By default
    the Illumina adapter file TruSeq3-PE-2.fa as distributed by the Trimmomatic
    project will be used.

.. option:: --keep-all

    Keep all intermediate files, by default some not-so-important intermediate
    results will be deleted to save disk space

.. option:: --less-mem

    This option will reduce the dominating memory requirements for the
    de-replication step by half, typically, and double the computation time.

.. option:: --no-dereplicate

    Option to skip the de-replication step

.. option:: --no-fasta-interleave

    Skip building the interleaved fasta file, interleaved fastq files will
    still be build.

.. option:: -S, --scythe-sickle

    Use scythe + sickle instead of (the default) Trimmomatic

.. option::  --working-dir=DIR

    Directory under which output is stored. By default this is the current
    directory.

.. option:: -h, --help

    Print help.

.. option:: --no-color

    Disable colorful output.

.. option:: -v, --verbosity=N

    Use one or multiple ``-v`` to increase verbosity of output or set a
    level of verbosity with ``--verbosity=N``.  By default the verbosity
    level is 1.  Setting verbosity to 0 silences the program.  A level of
    3 prints debugging info.


Exit Status
===========

Exits with non-zero upon encountering an error.
