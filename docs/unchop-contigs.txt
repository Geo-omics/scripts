unchop-contigs - Stitch together chopped up contigs after binning
=================================================================

Synopsis
========

:program:`unchop-contigs` [-h] [-i [BACKUP_SUFFIX] | -o OUT_DIR] [-v] [input [input ...]]


Description
===========

The CONCOCT binner recommends to chop long contigs into even length chunks to
reduce bias related to varying contigs sizes.  This script glues them back
together for downstream analysis of bins.

It is assumed that there is one fasta file per bin and that the fasta headers
consist of the original contig id followed by a dotand a decimal chunk number.
For example if a bin has three contig chunks named::

    k141_531759.0
    k141_531759.1
    k141_531759.2

they will be replaced by a single contig called::

    k141_531759.0-2

Contigs that do not have chunk information will be left alone.  However contigs
will be sorted by contig id and numerical chunk number.  A consequence is that
applying unchop-contig a second time may change the order of some contigs.


Options
=======

.. option:: input

    List of directories or fasta files. The default is to  take the
    current diorectory.

.. option:: -h, --help

    show this help message and exit

.. option:: -i [BACKUP_SUFFIX], --in-place [BACKUP_SUFFIX]

    Replace input file. If provided, backup of each file  is made using
    the provided suffix.

.. option:: -o OUT_DIR, --out-dir OUT_DIR

    Output directory. The default is the current  directory.

.. option:: -v, --verbose

    Print diagnostic output.


Exit Status
