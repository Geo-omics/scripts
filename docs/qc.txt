.. program:: qc

===================================================
qc - quality control for metagenomic Illumina reads
===================================================

Synopsis
========

:program:`qc` [OPTIONS]...


Description
===========

The :program:`qc` script takes a pair of fastq-formatted files (forward and
reverse reads) and runs them past quality assessment (FastQC), dereplication,
adapter removal (Scythe), and quality-trimming (Sickle) steps and then
prepares a FASTA-formatted interleaved reads file that can be used as input
for the IDBA assembler.  A second run of FastQC allows a before-after
comparison to see if these steps led to an improvement in the quality of the
data.


Options
=======

.. option:: -f, --fwd=FILE

    fastq-formatted file with forward reads, by default this is ``fwd.fastq``
    as saved by the :program:`prep` script

.. option:: -r, --rev=FILE

    fastq-formatted file with reverse reads, by default this is ``rev.fastq``
    as saved by the :program:`prep` script

.. option:: --clean-only

    Remove all files made by a previously run of :program:`qc` and exit.

.. option:: -a, --adapters=FILE

    Specify the adapters file used in the adpater trimming step.  By default
    the Illumina adapter file TruSeq3-PE-2.fa as distributed by the Trimmomatic
    project will be used.

.. option::  --working-dir=DIR

    Directory under which output is stored. By default this is the current
    directory.

.. option:: -h, --help

    Print help.

.. option:: --no-color

    Disable colorful output.

.. option:: -v, --verbosity=N

    Use one or multiple ``-v`` to increase verbosity of output or set a
    level of verbosity with ``--verbosity=N``.  By default the verbosity
    level is 1.  Setting verbosity to 0 silences the program.  A level of
    3 prints debugging info.


Exit Status
===========

Exits with non-zero upon encountering an error.
