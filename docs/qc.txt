.. program:: omics qc

===================================================
qc - quality control for metagenomic Illumina reads
===================================================

Synopsis
========

:program:`omics qc` [OPTIONS]... [SAMPLES]...


Description
===========

The :program:`omics qc` script takes raw reads from multiple samples and runs
them past quality assessment (FastQC), dereplication, adapter removal and
quality-trimming with Trimmomatic (or alternatively with Scythe and Sickle)
steps and then prepares a FASTA-formatted interleaved reads file that can be
used as input for the assembler.  A second run of FastQC allows a before-after
comparison to see if these steps led to an improvement in the quality of the
data.


positional arguments
====================

.. option:: samples

    List of directories, one per sample that contain the sample's reads. The
    default is to take the current directory and process a single sample. The
    names of the reads files must be fwd.fastq and rev.fastq, currently this
    can not be set manually. Use the omics-qc-sample script directly to
    specify filenames, omics-qc is just a wrapper after all.


Options
=======

.. option:: --clean-only

    Remove all files made by a previously run of :program:`qc` and exit.

.. option:: -a, --adapters=FILE

    Specify the adapters file used in the adpater trimming step.  By default
    the Illumina adapter file TruSeq3-PE-2.fa as distributed by the Trimmomatic
    project will be used.

.. option:: --keep-all

    Keep all intermediate files, by default some not-so-important intermediate
    results will be deleted to save disk space

.. option:: --no-dereplicate

    Option to skip the de-replication step

.. option:: --no-fasta-interleave

    Skip building the interleaved fasta file, interleaved fastq files will
    still be build.

.. option:: -S, --scythe-sickle

    Use scythe + sickle instead of (the default) Trimmomatic

.. option:: --cpus N, --threads N, -t N
    Number of threads / CPUs to employ

.. option:: -h, --help

    Print help.

.. option:: -v, --verbose

    Use one or multiple ``-v`` to increase verbosity of output.

Exit Status
===========

Exits with non-zero upon encountering an error.
