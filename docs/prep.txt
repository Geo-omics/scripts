.. program:: omics prep

============================================================
prep - prepare compressed fastq files for further processing
============================================================

Synopsis
========

:program:`omics prep` [OPTIONS]... [READS]...


Description
===========

To several tools of the Geomicro Illumina Reads Processing Pipeline assume
that raw or intermediate data is available in files following certain naming
conventions and formats and directory layout.  To get started the script
:program:`omics prep` will help following these conventions.  


Options
=======

.. option:: -f, --force

    Allow overwriting existing files.

.. option:: --keep-lanes-separate

    Keep data from different lanes separate. The default is to collect reads
    originating from the same physical sample if sequencing was done using
    several lanes.

.. option:: --suffix LIST

    Comma-separated list of valid file suffices used for raw reads. This is
    used to find files when a directory is given as positional argument. By
    default .fastq and .fastq.gz files are considered.

.. option:: -t N, --threads N, --cpus N

    Number of threads / CPUs to employ

.. option:: -h, --help

    Print help.

.. option:: -v, --verbose

    Use one or multiple ``-v`` to increase verbosity of output.

Exit Status
===========

Exits with non-zero upon encountering an error.
