createFastq.pl	-	Use the fasta and quality files to produce fastq files
CRISPR_spacer_extractor.pl	-	Given a fasta file with repeat sequences and a contig fasta file, get the positions of these repeats in the contigs and find the coordinates of spacers

getRandomData.pl	-	Extract a random % of data (fasta/fastq)
interleave.pl	-	Take the forward(1) and reverse(2) fasta/fastq files and arrange them such that all odd sequences are forward and evens are reverse.
